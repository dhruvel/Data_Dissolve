**CP470 Android Programming Final Project: DataDissolve**

# Proposal for Smart Phone Security Application Development

## Problem Statement

*In the digital age, the proliferation of data and the increased risks of identity theft and digital breaches have created a pressing need for enhanced data protection. Users often believe that they have deleted sensitive files, but they remain vulnerable to recovery. To address this, a reliable solution is required that ensures once data is deleted, it remains irrecoverable.*

## Project Objectives

Our project seeks to accomplish the following objectives:

1. Develop a user-friendly application that empowers users to securely delete sensitive files and folders, providing them with a sense of security and control over their data.
2. Enable users to wipe free space, safeguarding their digital footprint.
3. Promote better device performance by efficiently removing unwanted files and reducing fragmentation, resulting in a smoother and more optimized user experience.
4. Ensure user privacy is maintained by making deleted data irretrievable, thus mitigating the risks of identity theft and data breaches. This includes support for multiple languages.

## Stakeholders

The success of this project depends on collaboration and support from the following stakeholders:

- Project Developers:  Dhruv Sagar, Mark Simao, Zhenxiang Tang.
- Project Instructor: Dr. Abdul-Rahman Mawlood-Yunis.
- End Users: Individuals seeking to enhance data protection on their devices.

## Project Deliverables

### Description

Our project will yield a sophisticated application designed to permanently delete sensitive files and folders from your device, ensuring that they become completely irrecoverable. This is achieved through the implementation of cutting-edge data deletion algorithms, such as the Gutmann method, the DoD 5220.22-M standard, and the Schneider method, which overwrite data multiple times. Additionally, the application will efficiently clean up residual device spaces, including free space, cache, clipboard, and browser history.

### Benefits

Our project offers several compelling benefits:

1. Enhanced Privacy Protection: The application guarantees that your deleted information remains completely inaccessible, safeguarding you against potential identity theft and digital breaches.
2. Storage Space Optimization: By removing unnecessary and outdated files, the application helps declutter your device, resulting in significant storage space savings.
3. Boosted Performance: Reduced device clutter and fragmentation lead to smoother operation and improved overall performance.

### Key Features

Our application will feature the following:

1. In-App User Guide: An intuitive guide detailing the application's functionalities to ensure a user-friendly experience.
2. Sleek User Interface: Prioritizing the development of an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
3. Secure Authentication: Users must enter their username and password to log in, ensuring robust security.
4. Periodic Progress Reports: Regular updates and progress reports to keep users informed about the application's status and improvements.
5. Multi-Language Support: The application will be available in three different language versions - English, Hindi, and Chinese - to cater to a diverse user base.

Our project aims to provide a comprehensive solution to the growing need for data security and privacy in the digital world.

### Features:

1. In-app guide detailing the app's functionalities.
