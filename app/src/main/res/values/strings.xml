    <string name="description_default">The Default method employs a basic data sanitization technique by overwriting a file\'s content with randomly generated data. It generates a random byte array and writes it to the file in a loop until the entire file is filled. While this method introduces randomness for added security, it may not be as robust as more advanced algorithms like Gutmann or DoD methods. Please select any other method if you want to employ standardized sanitization methods to make your file unrecoverable.</string>
    <string name="description_gutmann">The Gutmann method is a data sanitization algorithm designed by Peter Gutmann. It is known for its thoroughness and involves overwriting data on a storage medium with a specific pattern of data multiple times. The method consists of 35 passes, each with a unique pattern, to ensure secure and irreversible data destruction. While it was initially developed for older technologies, its applicability to modern storage media is a subject of debate due to advancements in data recovery methods.</string>
    <string name="description_dod">The DoD data sanitization method is a set of standards defined by the U.S. Department of Defense for secure data erasure. The DoD 5220.22-M standard, in particular, outlines a three-pass approach for sanitizing data. The method involves overwriting the storage medium with a specific pattern in the first pass, its complement in the second pass, and a random pattern in the third pass. This method was originally designed for hard disk drives and is commonly used for secure data deletion in various contexts, including military and government applications.</string>
    <string name="description_schneier">The Schneier method, named after Bruce Schneier, is a simpler data sanitization approach compared to the Gutmann method. It involves overwriting the entire storage medium with a single pattern of data, typically zeros. While not as comprehensive as the Gutmann method, the Schneier method is considered sufficient for most common scenarios and provides a good balance between security and practicality.</string>
